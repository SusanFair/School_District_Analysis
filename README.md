# School_District_Analysis

## Analysis Summary

### Background
Starting with the student records from all the schools in the district, the school board requested that we provide some analysis on school budgets, students per school and grades. 

### Summary
In the analysis provided the following inforamtion was produced:
* Budget: The Public school budgets were higher than the Charter schools
  * Public: 911,196 vs Charter: 872,626
* Reading & Math: Both Math and Reading scores were higher in the Charter schools vs the Public schools
  * Charter: 72.5 and 66.7 vs Public: 72.3 and 62.9
  
Overall, although there is a difference in budget the grad averages between Charter and Public schools are quite similar with Charter schools having a slight advantage despite their lower overall budget.

### Opportunities for further analysis

In reviewing math scores by grade in Charter schools we see something of interest that could be an opportunity for further analysis.  Math scores in the Charter schools were higher than Public schools in all grades except grade 12.  A further anlysis of total number of students in grade 12 may help provide forther inforamtion as to why Charter math scores dropped in the grade 12 students.

Further analysis could be performed as well to compare school populations vs grades as well.
